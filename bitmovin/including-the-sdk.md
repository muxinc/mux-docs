/*
Title: Including the SDK
*/

Include the bitmovin-mux file after the core Bitmovin javascript file in the page. Use the Mux-hosted version of the script to receive automatic updates (the API will not change within major versions). Note that `stable` and `6` in the example on the right can be replaced with the Release Channel and player version (5 or 6), respectively, that you want to use.

```

<script src="//src.litix.io/bitmovin/2/bitmovin-mux.js"></script>
