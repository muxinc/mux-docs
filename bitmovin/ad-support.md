Mux supports Bitmovin's <code>vast</code> advertising client for pre-, mid-, and post-roll ads. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

The metrics for preroll request and response times, as well as number of requests, are pending an update to Bitmovin's API. Everything else will operate normally, but those metrics may be missing.
