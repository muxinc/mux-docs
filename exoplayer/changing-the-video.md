When you change to a new video (in the same player) you need to update the information that Mux knows about the current video. Examples of when this is needed are:

* The player advances to the next video in a playlist
* The user selects a different video to play

**You do not need to change the video info when changing to a different source of the same video content (e.g. different resolution or video format).**

It's best to change the video info immediately before telling the player which new source to play.

This is done by calling <code>MuxStats.videoChange(CustomerVideoData)</code> which will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view. See <a href="options-and-metadata">metadata</a> for the list of video details you can provide. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with <code>video_</code>.
