Mux has been tested with and supports Ooyala's <code>google-ima-ads-manager</code>. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other Ooyala ad integrations, such as <code>FreeWheel</code> and <code>VAST/VPAID</code> may work out of the box. Please <a href="mailto:help@mux.com">contact us</a> with any questions.
