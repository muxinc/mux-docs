# Integration

While Mux is still in early development we support two browser-based video players: <strong>Video.js</strong> and the bare <strong>HTML5 video element</strong>. Select one from the language menu. More players and platforms, including other desktop players, native SDKs for iOS and Android, and SDKs for OTT platforms are coming soon.

## Core Mux embed

```html
<script>
  window.mux=window.mux||function(){(mux.q=mux.q||[]).push([arguments,1*new Date()]);};
  mux('set', 'property_key', 'EXAMPLE-PROPERTY-KEY');
  mux('send', 'pageloadstart');
</script>
<script async src='//src.litix.io/core/1/mux.js'></script>
```

```
<script>
  window.mux=window.mux||function(){(mux.q=mux.q||[]).push([arguments,1*new Date()]);};
  mux('set', 'property_key', 'EXAMPLE-PROPERTY-KEY');
  mux('send', 'pageloadstart');
</script>
<script async src='//src.litix.io/core/1/mux.js'></script>
```

```html
<script>
  window.mux=window.mux||function(){(mux.q=mux.q||[]).push([arguments,1*new Date()]);};
  mux('set', 'property_key', 'EXAMPLE-PROPERTY-KEY');
  mux('send', 'pageloadstart');
</script>
<script async src='//src.litix.io/core/1/mux.js'></script>
```

Put the core Mux embed code in the document &lt;head&gt;. This needs to be included at the top of the page in order to ensure that we can track page loads when the user navigates away quickly.

## videojs-mux plugin

Some some

```videojs_html
<!-- Include the videojs-mux plugin after Video.js. -->
<script src="/path/to/video.js"></script>
<script src="//src.litix.io/videojs/1/videojs-mux.js"></script>
```


```videojs
// If you already initialize a Video.js player via JavaScript, you
// can include mux in the plugin object in settings.
videojs('my-cool-player', {
  plugins: {
    mux: {}
  }
});
```

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```html
<!-- Using the data-setup attribute -->
<video id="my-cool-player" data-setup='{"plugins": {"mux": {}}}'>...</video>
```

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```javascript
// You can also initialize the mux plugin separately. Here we check to make sure
// the videojs-mux plugin has already been successfully loaded first.
var player = videojs('my-cool-player');
if (typeof player.mux !== 'undefined') {
  var mux = player.mux({});
}
```

If you want to integrate Mux with a Video.js player, you will need to include the videojs-mux plugin. This has two steps.

First, include the videojs-mux. Put the following script tag in your page somewhere after you have already included Video.js itself:

`<script src="//src.litix.io/videojs/1/videojs-mux.js"></script>`

Second, initialize the plugin in your player settings when you normally initialize a Video.js plugin. This can be done in multiple ways.

<aside class="notice">Make sure that the videojs-mux plugin is included *after* Video.js itself is loaded.</aside>


## Changing the video

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```javascript
var myPlayer = videojs('my-cool-player');

myPlayer.mux.setVideo({
  video_id: 'abcd123',
  video_title: 'Really Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos'
});

////
// Code that changes the player source is here
////
```

When you change to a new video (in the same player) you need to update the video data using the `setVideo` function. Some examples of when this happens are:

* The player advances to the next video in a playlist
* The user selects a different video to play

It's best to do this immediately before telling the player which new source to play, so that no events are lost.

When setVideo is called it removes all previous video data and resets all metrics for the video view.

<aside class="notice">This does not include changing the source to a new resolution or rendition of the same video.</aside>

# API Parameters

## General

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```javascript
videojs('my-cool-player', {
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      debug: false
    }
  }
});
```

Name	| Description	| Default
----------- | ----------- | --------
debug	| Put the plugin in debug mode to log operational details	| false
heart_beat_interval	| How often to send heartbeats (in ms) | 10000
check_buffering_interval | How often to check whether or not the player is buffering (in ms) | 100

## Video Metadata

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```javascript
videojs('my-cool-player', {
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      debug: false,
      video_data: {
        video_title: 'My Great Video'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

Video data can be set to provide more information about the video that's being played. It can be set in the Mux plugin options, or with the `player.mux.setVideo()` function after the plugin has been initialized.

When you change the video title that a player is playing you will also need to use `player.mux.setVideo()` to update the video details. This does not include when you change to a different source (e.g. a different resolution) of the same title.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
video_id | Your internal ID for the video
video_title | Video Title, ex: "Awesome Show Episode 1"
video_series | Video Series, ex: "Season 1"
video_variant_name | Video Variant, ex: "French Hard Subs"
video_variant_id | Video Variant ID, ex: "abcd1234abcd"
video_language | The language of the video
video_content_type | "short", "movie", "episode", "clip", "trailer", or "event"
video_duration | The length of the video. (Can also be determined from the player.)
video_stream_type | "live" or "on-demand"
video_producer | The producer of the video title
video_encoding_variant | Which encoding profile is being used, when testing multiple.

## Player

<div class="before-video-js"></div>

```javascript
videojs('my-cool-player', {

      debug: false,
      player_data: {
        player_name: 'My Main Player',
      }
    }

player_name | Player Name, ex: "My Site Main Player"
player_version | Player Version, ex: "2.0.0"
