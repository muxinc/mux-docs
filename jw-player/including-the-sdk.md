Title: Including the SDK
*/

Include the jwplayer-mux file after the core JW Player javascript file in the page. Use the Mux-hosted version of the script to receive automatic updates (the API will not change within major versions). Note that key in the example on the right should be replaced with the key provided by JW Player for your account.

```

<script src="//src.litix.io/jwplayer/2/jwplayer-mux.js"></script>
