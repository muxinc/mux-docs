Mux has been tested with and supports JW Player's <code>vast</code> integration for pre-, mid-, and post-roll ads. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other JW Player ad integrations, such as <code>googima</code> and <code>freewheel</code> have not been tested, but may work out of the box. Please <a href="mailto:help@mux.com">contact us</a> with any questions.
